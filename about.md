Pasty is pronounced "pass-tee", `\ˈpas-tē\`. 
It doesn't sound like "paste". 
[Definition one at Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pasty){:target="_blank"} says it correctly.
    
Most importantly, pasties are delicious.

National Pasty Awareness Week seeks to share this truth with all Americans. 

### Participate

Please join us by posting your stories, images, recipes, and encouragement on social media with the hashtag `#PastyAware`. 

Pasty Awareness is best celebrated by eating several pasties. 
If you are lucky enough to live in a region where pasties are readily available, I suggest you go out and get some! 
Otherwise you should probably visit the [Upper Peninsula of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan) or try to [make your own](http://www.hu.mtu.edu/vup/pasty/recipes.htm). 
Pasties are occasionally available outside of their traditional heartland, but the quality is usually suspect. 

### Impacts

National Pasty Awareness Week promotes:

* increased well being from eating delicious foods. 
* increased community building around the love of pasties.
* increased tourism in pasty-bearing regions. 
* increased pasty related economic opportunity across America.
