Pasties are delicious. 

National Pasty Awareness Week seeks to share this truth with all Americans. 

### Participate

Please join us by posting your stories, images, recipes, and encouragement on social media. 

Pasty Awareness is best celebrated by eating several pasties. If you are lucky enough to live in a region where pasties are readily available, I suggest you go out and get some! Otherwise you should probably visit the [Upper Peninsula of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan) or try to [make your own](http://www.hu.mtu.edu/vup/pasty/recipes.htm). Pasties are occasionally available outside of their traditional heartland, but the quality is usually suspect. 

### Impacts

National Pasty Awareness Week promotes:

* increased well being from eating delicious foods. 
* increased community building around the love of pasties.
* increased tourism in pasty-bearing regions. 
* increased pasty related economic opportunity across America.
