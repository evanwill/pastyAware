[Pasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasty){:target="_blank"} are an important cultural food for the diverse peoples of [Upper Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan){:target="_blank"} and the [Iron Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Range){:target="_blank"} of Minnesota.
They are delicious!

**National Pasty Awareness Week** seeks to bring attention to this little known cultural treasure to improve the lives of all Americans. 

In solidarity with the movement, replace your social media profile image with a [pasty]({{ '/assets/images/pastyProfile.jpg' | relative_url }} "pasty").
