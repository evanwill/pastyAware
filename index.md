# #PastyAware

![Pasty](/images/pasty.jpg "pasty")

[Pasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasty) are an important cultural food for the diverse peoples of [Upper Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan) and the [Iron Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Range) of Minnesota. They are delicious!

**National Pasty Awareness Week** seeks to bring attention to this little known cultural treasure to improve the lives of all Americans. 

In solidarity with the movement, replace your social media profile image with a [pasty](/images/pastyProfile.jpg "pasty"). Then, share your favorite pasty related anecdotes, recipes, and encouragement on social media with the hashtag [#PastyAware](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23PastyAware).
