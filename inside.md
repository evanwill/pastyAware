![Pasty Insides]({{ '/assets/images/pastyInsides.jpg' | relative_url }} "pasty insides")

## Pasties are made of two parts:

1. crust (outside)
2. filling (inside)

Both parts are delicious. 

I suggest eating them at the same time, although others may pick them apart and eat them separately.

Adding a sauce such as [ketchup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketchup){:target="_blank"} is optional, but can be quite tasty.
Some people add gravy for some unknown reason.
Pasties are plenty delicious *without* gravy.
