![Pasty Insides](/images/pastyInsides.jpg "pasty insides")

## Pasties are made of two parts:

1. crust (outside)
2. filling (inside)

Both parts are delicious. 

I suggest eating them at the same time, although others may pick them apart and eat them seporately.

Adding a sauce such as [ketchup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketchup) is optional, but can be quite tasty. Some people add gravy for some unknown reason.
